    "Why is this a valid event? Because `duration` and `data` are optional, and `ts` and `id` can be automatically assigned when the event is added to a stream. In short, events only require a timestamp and id to be assigned when they are added to an ordered collection of events (an event stream). Just creating a new Event object in Python doesn't save it anywhere. It's only when assigned to a stream that this event is persisted. This allows us to build up events incrementally before storing them on the backend.\n",
